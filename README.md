## üìö Technical Overview

* **Express** sets up routing and middleware
* **Mongoose** defines schemas:

  * `User` ‚Äì username, unique email, hashed password + timestamps
  * `Contact` ‚Äì name, email, phone, `user_id` reference, timestamps
* **bcrypt** hashes passwords securely
* **jsonwebtoken** issues and verifies short-lived JWTs
* **async-handler** for centralized `async/await` error handling
* **validateTokenHandler** middleware:

  * Extracts and verifies JWTs from `Authorization` headers
  * Attaches `request.user` for downstream handlers

---

## ‚úÖ Development To-Dos

* [ ] Implement **logout** / token revocation
* [ ] Use **refresh tokens** for longer sessions
* [ ] Add **Joi/express-validator** for request validation
* [ ] Improve **error messages/types** in middleware
* [ ] Expand **test coverage** (e.g., Jest + Supertest)
* [ ] Add API docs with **Swagger** or **Postman collection**
